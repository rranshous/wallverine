# Idea

I want to put something fun on the wall

# Context

We are working in VSCode hosted in github codespaces.
I have our IDE in one window.
The other monitor is a projector pointed at a wall.

This project is for fun, it is play.

# Goal

Have something fun and possibly (voice) interactive on the wall

# Tech guidance

Typescript
HTML5 / canvas
browser voice for voice commands
inference (via anthropic) _only_ if no other method exists

# Personal note to AI

Looking forward to collab
